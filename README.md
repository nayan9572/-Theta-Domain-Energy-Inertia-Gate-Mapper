# -Theta-Domain-Energy-Inertia-Gate-Mapper
🧠 A θ-domain (crank-angle based) reduced-order engine reasoning framework that maps energy → inertia → resistance saturation to identify physical gates before heavy simulation.  🔍 Think first. Simulate later. ❌ Not CFD / GT-Power replacement ✅ Trend, risk &amp; boundary intelligence 🚦 Finds where scaling breaks, not how to break it
